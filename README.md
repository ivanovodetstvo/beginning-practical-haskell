An introductory Haskell programming course by [Richard Cook][rcookdotorg]

* [View Beginning Practical Haskell course online][course]

This is the source code for the course notes and code examples.

## Generating the course notes

The course notes are rendered using [Pandoc][pandoc] in the [`gh-pages`][gh-pages] branch of this repo. Please view the [`README.md`][gh-pages-readme] file in this branch for more information.

You can also [view the content directly in GitHub](index.md), but note that this is only an approximation to the Pandoc output. GitHub does not, for example, render MathJax/LaTeX markup and so some of the mathematics and other advanced markup features in this course may only be viewable in its intended form in the Pandoc output.
